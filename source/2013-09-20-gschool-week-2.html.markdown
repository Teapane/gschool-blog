It is week two here at gSchool in Denver, Colorado.  The weather has been insanely wet, with constant flooding all around the state; however, I can't let it dampen my mood!

We were given a project to work on this week titled "Event Reporter." The basic premise of the project was to take a CSV (comma seperated value) file and create a program around it to make the data much more legible and readable.  We were also given the task of being able to search the file for specific attributes, and save them to a file.  To say the least, the project wasn't easy. 

Everyone was assigned a partner to work on and complete the project with; I had the pleasure of working with Will Mitchell, a badass programer to say the least.  Will has a much stronger grasp of Ruby and programming than I do, and really knew what he was doing with the project.  It was crazy to see how quickly he could jump into the program and immediately start writing code and tests to help the code.  I was in over my head, but Will was awesome about talking through the steps and showing me how the code and tests worked.  He was great about asking me questions and really trying to get me to think about why we were doing what we were doing and asking me to make the next logical conclusion.  Needless to say, Will is an awesome programmer as well as teacher and I look forward to working with him again in the future.  

We worked on the project in what is lovingly known as "the pit" here at galvanize.  We worked during the assigned time, but also stayed late to attempt to complete the project.  On Wednesday night, we stayed until about 10 and nearly completed the project.  

What I have completed (Will has gone on to finish the project, and also refactor it) is available here: https://github.com/TylerLong86/EventReporter 

I have not completed the project as of yet.  I have decided that I need to go ahead and start over, from scratch, and attempt to do it my own way. While it was great working with Will, I need to start over in order to really grasp the concepts of it for my self.
