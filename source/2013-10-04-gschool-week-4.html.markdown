Last week marked the beginning of Sales Engine; a tutorial centered around CSV files and creating multiple repositories that can "talk" to one another through a common engine.  It was a culmination of everything we had learned thus far :testing, string manipulation, linking multiple files together, etc.  The project was quite the undertaking and was very challenging to say the least.

For the project, we were assigned a partner randomly.  Having a partner is both a good thing and a challenging aspect of the assignment.  I found it difficult to get work done with a partner, as there were always schedule conflicts.  We were able to work on the project together during assigned class time, but outside of class I worked mostly solo.  I liked working together when time allowed because it allowed us to do "ping-pong pairing".  One would write a test and the other would make it pass via screenhero.  I did enjoy this aspect of it.  However, I find it difficult to work in pairs sometimes due to scheduling conflicts as well as different levels of understanding.  It was helpful for me in some ways to help explain the concepts I understood.  

I am now four weeks into the program and I am not quite sure how I feel.  I know I have learned an insane amount of programming, but it is daunting to know how much there still is to learn.  I feel relatively comfortable with the content, but I still need to really buckle down to grasp the concepts more deeply.  Coming from a strong science and math background, I found that I learned best in classes such as mathematical proofs, and advanced organic synthesis: these classes showed the root of how things worked in these fields, and I need to find a way to understanding that in programming. I know I can do it, it will just take time! And believe me, I will dedicate the time!

It is difficult to guess where my skills will be in five months, but if I were to plot on a graph what I know now to what I knew four weeks ago, it is growing almost exponentially.  It is exciting to think that in five months I will have a really solid understanding of Ruby, Rails and a little bit of JavaScript.  I am absolutely excited to see where this skill set will take me.  So, in five months I will be a badass (or so I hope!).

As far as learning strategies go, I have determined some that are really working for me.  First, repetition, repetition, repetition; doing things over and over really lets me grasp what I am doing and helps in my understanding.  Second, for my learning is time management.  I have noticed that once I reach the 12-14 hour mark, I am no longer being productive.  It makes more sense for me to go home and sleep than to just sit and stare mindlessly at my computer screen. Third, which is directly correlated to time management, is breaking up what I am working on.  I have noticed if I am crunching code for a few hours, it really helps me to take a breather and work on something different; this includes, regex crosswords, reading about ruby or programming, or going back to my old days of Organic Chemistry and reading about new discoveries, etc.  If I focus on one thing for too long, my brain becomes a little tired, and I need a quick break to refresh how I am working.  

All in all, only time will tell what the next five months hold for me and my journey to becoming a programmer.  One thing is for certain, I am excited to see wherever it takes me and am ready to jump into the deep end!
