In the fifth week here at gSchool, we focused on solidifying the concepts we have learned thus far.  Titled "Focus Week", the goal was to go back and really nail down concepts and ideas we were struggling with.  I found this week both very useful and fufilling.  It was very helpful to have a week of purely reviewing past concepts in order to prepare ourselves for upcoming projects.  

Next week we are diving into the web, starting with Sinatra, and from what I have heard, this is a very difficult step from what we have been doing.  Thankfully, focus week allowed me to really nail down ruby concepts that are needed to really work within the web framework. 

During "Focus Week", everyone was split up into three groups: fundamentals, progress, and advance. I worked with Jeff and a group of 8 students labeled the progress group.  We were the group that was "middle of the road".  We understood enough Ruby syntax and ideas, but really need to focus on writing better code and corresponding tests.  What I took away the most from these sessions was writing tests that actually test something relevant.  Prior to this, I felt like my tests were asserting what I wanted them too, not what they should assert. Throughout the week, I really started to grasp the idea of writing relevant tests that would assert that the methods I was writing were actually outputting what they should.  

Though I feel like I gained a much better understanding of writing good tests, I still feel like I need to practice writing tighter, more concise code.  We worked a bit on refactoring, but I am still a little unclear about it.  I understand the end goal: eliminate verbous code, tighten up methods, and make the code as readable as possible, yet, I still need to work on it.  Since I am just getting started in the whole idea of programming, I find that I try and write code that is too long and not to the point.  This isn't a conscious choice, it is the only way I can get things to work.  Therefore, over the weekend I would really like to dive into the code I have already written and look at how it could be changed.  I understand now that having many methods is not a bad thing, were as before I thought it was all about writing ridiculously long methods instead of breaking seperate components out.  

I found that working in a smaller group with my fellow comrades at a similiar skill level was very beneficial.  Since all of us were roughly on the same page, it allowed for relevant discussion and most of the questions asked were similiar to ones I would ask.  I feel like I really got to know everyone in my group a little bit better and I look forward to working with them in the future.  It was also cool gettting to work with Jeff so closely; he is an awesome teacher and really good at breaking things down into smaller components and then stitching them back together into a cohesive whole. 

If given the opportunity to work with smaller groups for the duration of the class I am not really sure what I would choose.  I do like the smaller class aspect, but I would also like the chance to work with people with a higher skill level than my own.  I have noticed that those who are really getting it so far are also really enthusiastic about teaching and always willing to help out.  Shout outs to @WVmitchell, @RoleTLe, @SimonTaranto, @benhorne44 and Brian , who apparently I don't follow on twitter, for all the help. You guys are awesome and I look forward to working with you at some point.  

So, focus week is over.  Next week is starting the web. How do I feel? I have no idea.  I am nervous, I am excited, I am ...

 It is interesting how the class works; once you feel like you have an understanding of the concepts, something totally new is thrown at you.  I am not complaining whatesoever, it makes perfect sense from a teaching standpoint.  If I am constantly pushed I feel like I will ultimately learn more.  I know this held true when I was studying Chemistry; if I became complacent my learning became stagnant, yet when I constantly pushed myself my learning flourished.   I am hoping to apply this idea to my learning here at gSchool. Though really nervous, I am also super excited to learn the web.  Considering how often the internet  has a presence in my day to day life, it will be fascinating to learn how it actually all works. I came to gSchool to learn how to write web applications, so I guess I better start now. 

 So, all in all, I am really excited to learn the web, but also have no idea what that will entail. So, heres to being thrown into another new situation I have absolutely no idea about and coming out understanding it.  I mean, considering I didn't know a single thing about Ruby when I came in, and now I can actually make it work, I am ready for whatever challenge is next.
