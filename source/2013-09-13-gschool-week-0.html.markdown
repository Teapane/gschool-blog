 It is week one here at gSchool in Denver, CO.  We are jumping right into ruby and it is both exciting and intimidating at the same time.  This is one of the first times in a school environment that I have felt like I didn't have a grasp of the material presented.  I look forward to seeing what the future holds and am very excited about gSchool!
